These are my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) ðŸŽ„. the days are divided into single ``.cpp`` files _(each including part 2)_ and can be easily compiled with the ``make`` command.
the code is **originally intended to run on linux** - but should work on other platforms, too!
